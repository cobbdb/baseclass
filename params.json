Code in natural JavaScript but now with the power of simple\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\nHere's a quick example showing a typical class setup.\r\n\r\n    // Your app's library\r\n    var Pet = function (name) {\r\n        return {\r\n            name: name,\r\n            speak: function () {\r\n                console.log('Hi there!');\r\n            },\r\n            // Just add this one method to your base class and\r\n            // you're all set up! Simple as can be!\r\n            extend: BaseClass\r\n        };\r\n    };\r\n    var Dog = function (name) {\r\n        return Pet(name).extend({\r\n            color: 'grey',\r\n            speak: function () {\r\n                this.base.speak();\r\n                console.log(\"I'm \" + name + \" and I'm a \"  + this.color + ' dog.');\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    // Your app's runtime\r\n    var woofie = Dog('Woofie');\r\n    woofie.speak(); // --> Hi there! I'm Woofie and I'm a grey dog.\r\n\r\nThis inheritance chain can continue on as deep as you want it to be. To reach deeper into the\r\nchain, just use the `.base` notation. For example if you want data from two levels deep, that\r\nwould look like `child.base.base.data`.\r\n\r\nSince all properties are brought over to each child, your will always have access to an `extend`\r\nmethod to create more children.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n* See: http://cobbdb.github.io/baseclass/\r\n* See: http://github.com/cobbdb/baseclass\r\n* License: MIT\r\n","google":"UA-50240363-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
